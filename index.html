              Hello, this is me! My name is Eva Pointner, I am originally a
              landscape architect with very, very varied interests. In the past
              I have planned gardens, but I've also worked a lot with children
              of all ages and knowledge transfer regardless of age. I am also on
              a first-name-basis with most kinds of trees and am generally a
              geek about botany.
              <br />
              In my free time, I like to teach myself Chinese and even though it
              might seem like a weird comparison, learning to code feels a lot
              like learning Chinese to me. There definitely is an appeal in
              learning things you never expected to learn, so everything that
              works feels like a big accomplishment.
              <br />
              I also like to craft all kinds of things. Right now I'm fixated on
              Origami, but I can feel embroidery coming up next.
              <br />
              One of my best friends has been bugging me about how I should
              become a developer for the past three years now and now that I'm
              looking for a career change, I have given in and loved (almost)
              every minute of it. She's been practicing her smug face ever
              since.

            <h3>My little terrarium</h3>
            <p>
              This was the very first project I did for the Frontend Foxes. My
              struggles at the beginning have turned out to be a misplaced curly
              bracket, which I've been told is very common, so I guess I made a
              good first effort to get the first mistakes out of the way.
              <br />
              Enjoy playing around with the plants in my terrarium and placing
              them where you like them best.

            <h3>My first personal website</h3>
            <p>
              This is actually the very first project I did in a day-long
              workshop with the
              <a href="https://female-coders.at/">Female Coders Linz</a> a
              couple of months ago. Please ignore the nonsensical text, I had
              not prepared any content and it was then that I found out that
              Lorem ipsum text generators exist that mimic Donald Trump.
              <br />
              I am still quite proud of the styling and the overall aesthetic.
              And my creative quotes.

              Since I have no more finished projects to show, have a
              complimentary picture of my cat Jennie, who is also a certified
              Frontend Fox by now, the first feline developer of our cohort.
              (And also because it is illegal to have only pictures of one of
              your two children on your website.)
